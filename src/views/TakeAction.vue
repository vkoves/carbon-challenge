        Looking for ways to take action against climate change? We have a few
        ideas.
      </p>

      <h2>Policy</h2>

      <p>
        Climate change is too big to be solved by just individual lifestyle
        changes - we need new policies to reduce emissions around the world!
        Talking to your elected leaders about your concerns and specific
        policies you want to see can be one of the biggest things you can do to
        combat climate change.

        <li>
          <a href="https://call4climate.com/">Call4Climate (USA)</a> -
          Call4Climate is a hotline that connects you to your representatives in
          Congress, so you can tell them to support aggressive policies to
          combat climate change.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Individual Actions</h2>

      <ul class="bulleted">
        <li>
          <strong>Talk To Your Friends About Climate Change</strong> - No matter
          what actions you choose to take, from voting to changing your
          lifestyle, encouraging your friends to do the same can <em>vastly</em>
          increase your impact!
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Electrify Your Appliances</strong> - you might have home
          appliances like a stove, water heater, or dryer that burn fossil fuels
          right in your very home, and will emit CO<sub>2</sub> for the
          rest of their lifespan. Switching to electric appliances can have a
          huge effect, especially if your electricity is from mostly renewable
          sources.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Fly Less</strong> - a round-trip flight, especially
          long-distance can often emit over a ton of CO<sub>2</sub> <em>per
          passenger</em>! Especially if you're someone who flies often, reducing
          the amount you fly can have a big impact.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Drive Less</strong> - road transport accounts for a
          significant share of global emissions, so switching to eco-friendly
          options like walking, biking, or public transit can be a big step to
          reducing your emissions.
