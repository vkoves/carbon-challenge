        The Carbon Challenge is a project made by
        <a href="https://viktorkoves.com/">Viktor KÃ¶ves</a> with help from lots
        of wonderful folks in coding, translation, and art.
      </p>

      <p>
        The Carbon Challenge is an open-source project, so if you want to help make the Carbon Challenge better, or just see how it works,
        <a href="https://github.com/vkoves/carbon-challenge">check it out on GitHub</a>!
      </p>

      <h2>Disclaimers</h2>

      <p>
        The Carbon Challenge is a project made by non-scientists, and although
        we did a lot of research it is a layer of estimates on estimates and is
        thus not a truly accurate <em>simulation</em> of climate change or
        emissions.
      </p>

      <p>
        To put that into context, here are a few <em>incorrect</em> assumptions
        our model makes:
      </p>

      <ul class="bulleted">
        <li>
          <strong>Without policy, emissions remain constant</strong> - this
          isn't true in both emission growth and reduction. Even in the abscence
          of any policy, climate change awareness and economic factors will
          likely reduce some types of emissions. However, as economies grow and
          develop, some regions may see increased emissions in the short-term.
          Our model doesn't account for any of that.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Policies are made and enacted globally</strong> - although
          some global organizations like the United Nations might make policy
          recommendations, most policy decisions are made locally and vary region
          by region, meaning emissions likewise vary region by region!
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Policies are perfectly enforced</strong> - no policy is
          perfect or perfectly enforced, and this includes climate change
          policy. Our models assume that a ban on gas cars would mean there are
          zero gas vehicles left on the road at all, but that's extremely
          unlikely in the real world.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        With all that in mind, <strong>the Carbon Challenge should not be used
        in place of accurate climate models</strong>. It's intended as a
        starting point for non-scientists to think about
        <em>order of magnitude</em> differences between different policies. That
        means that we want to be accurate in saying one policy is
        <em>several times</em> more effective than another, but we likely aren't
        going to be as accurate in comparing two policies that have similar size
        impacts.
      </p>
